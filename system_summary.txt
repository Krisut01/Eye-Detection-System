                    EYE DETECTION & FATIGUE MONITORING SYSTEM
                              Technical Summary
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This system implements a real-time computer vision solution for detecting eye states 
(open/closed) and monitoring driver fatigue through continuous eye tracking. The 
system combines deep learning with traditional computer vision techniques to provide 
robust, real-time detection capabilities.

ARCHITECTURE
------------
The system consists of two main components:

1. MODEL TRAINING MODULE (ptrainer_torch.py)
   - PyTorch-based deep learning pipeline
   - EfficientNet-V2-S backbone with transfer learning
   - Custom classifier for binary eye state classification
   - Advanced data augmentation and preprocessing
   - Stratified dataset splitting for robust evaluation

2. REAL-TIME DETECTION MODULE (pyrun.py)
   - Live camera feed processing
   - Dual detection approach: CNN + MediaPipe landmarks
   - Temporal consistency algorithms
   - Fatigue alert system with audio notifications

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
------------------------
• Framework: PyTorch with CUDA acceleration support
• Model: EfficientNet-V2-S (ImageNet pretrained)
• Input Resolution: 224x224 pixels
• Camera Resolution: 1280x720 (configurable)
• Detection Methods: CNN classification + Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
• Processing: Real-time (30 FPS target)
• Platform: Windows-compatible with cross-platform support

DETECTION METHODOLOGY
---------------------
1. CNN-Based Detection:
   - Preprocessed frames fed to trained EfficientNet model
   - Binary classification: open eyes (class 1) vs closed eyes (class 0)
   - High confidence threshold (0.85) for closed eye detection
   - Image enhancement using CLAHE for improved accuracy

2. Landmark-Based Detection:
   - MediaPipe face mesh for facial landmark extraction
   - Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation for both eyes
   - Adaptive thresholds based on eye size and distance
   - Dynamic cropping for small face detection

3. Fusion Algorithm:
   - Weighted combination of CNN and landmark methods
   - Temporal consistency with hysteresis to prevent flickering
   - Ultra-conservative detection logic to minimize false positives
   - State persistence with configurable dwell times

TRAINING PIPELINE
-----------------
• Dataset: Stratified split (train/validation/test)
• Augmentation: Rotation, flipping, color jitter, affine transforms
• Loss Function: Label smoothing cross-entropy (0.1 smoothing)
• Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay (1e-4)
• Learning Rate: Adaptive with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler
• Fine-tuning: Progressive unfreezing of feature layers
• Early Stopping: Based on validation accuracy threshold (80%)

FATIGUE DETECTION
-----------------
• Threshold: 1.5 seconds of continuous closed eyes
• Alert System: Audio alarm with 3-second cooldown
• Visual Feedback: Real-time status overlay
